# Meme Generator Sprint 6-7 Windows Testing Documentation
- Get Meme and Last Meme buttons work as expected, even between the pressing of the AI and OG toggle
  - Placement in meme list is maintained, also while switching between AI and OG toggles
- The Generate Meme button still successfully integrates DALL-E AI image generation
- Adjectives do not break DALL-E
  - They do, however, seem to not have much of an effect on the generated meme, i.e. the prompt has significantly more of an impact on the resultant image
- Share buttons work regardless of screen orientation
  - Program does not have to be in full screen in order for the share buttons to take you to their intended destination
