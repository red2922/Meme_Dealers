# Sprint 4 Testing Documentation
## For Mac:
- Takes around 15-30 seconds for everything to load and be able to press any button
- Selecting any button can either take 2-15 seconds to register input or allow me to click again
  - Solved for some reason when I shrink window size???? (most consistent method, sometimes just clicking off and back onto the window works as well)
- Flipping from saved AI to saved OG memes works as intended
  - Once flipped, stacks are emptied and goes to correctly chosen meme folder
- Generate meme seems to always use brand-new AI generated meme, even when OG is chosen (intended?)
