# The Konami Code Easter Egg
Almost everyone who has played a video game has heard of the classic konami code that the former gaming company
implemented into most of their games. The original up->up->down->down->left->right->left->right->B->A->SELECT->START
was modified in this version to Get Meme->Get Meme->Last Meme->Last Meme->Get Meme->Last Meme->Get Meme->Last Meme, which
then activates a special meme of a snake playing dead with the Metal Gear Solid sound effect and Game Over screen, all a
reference to my favorite video game series of all time, Metal Gear, made by Hideo Kojima and his magnificent team.
