Have you ever needed a little pick-me-up after a hard day or a chuckle during your break, but you don’t want to dig through your
millions of files to find your memes? Wouldn’t it be nice if you could just find any one of your countless memes to bring that
smirk across your face at just a click of a button? Our client sure wishes that, so we’re making a Meme Generator program that
will find and create memes for our client using Python! With just a click of a button, our meme generator will find and make a
meme just for you, whenever you need it. This will be in multiple phases, starting with the Meme Generator pulling already saved
memes and choosing a random one and ending with the program taking meme text and meme photos, slapping them together and making
brand new memes for the user to view. While these first few iterations are fairly secure since the user can only click a button to generate a meme, this will become a much more prevalent issue if we decide to implement the program to work with an API, as this will have to be closely monitored to ensure encryption and prevent potential malware/injections from outside users. This will be taking place over the course of March 28th-April 12th (3 weeks), and after
work is finished, maintenance will fall on the client.
