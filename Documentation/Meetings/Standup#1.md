#March 29th Meme Generator Standup
&nbsp; Today’s standup was a productive one. From making our very first iteration of the meme generator and testing it, we decided
that the best course of action was to change from using streamlit to TkInter for our GUI, as it would allow us more control over
the interface and subsequently give us more control over security. We also assigned work around to everyone to make sure everyone
was contributing and nobody was overworking themselves. We also discussed various potential additions to the program, with the
biggest having the program work with an API. This would be done to get more meme images and text for each photo to truly create
never-before-seen memes that the user could download, which is another feature we pondered on, along with allowing the user to
choose what genre of memes they’d like to generate and the addition of back and forward buttons to see memes previously generated.
These additions would bring their own security concerns, such as how to monitor user input and ensuring communication with the API
is secure and the key never being pushed into main.
