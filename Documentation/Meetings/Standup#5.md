# Meme Generator Standup Meeting Record #5 (April 8th, 2024)
This meeting was a fairly short and straightforward one. We presented our current documentation and iteration to
our client, where we got back some very valuable feedback which would help us make the program more efficient and
implement our share button a bit better. After this, we talked about what more work needed to be done, and decided
that the best course of action was to look a bit more into the share button and then having a bit more fun by adding
in our own easter eggs for the user to find and then to tidy the program up in the next iteration.
Tasks for everyone:
- Everyone: Add easter eggs (1 each)
- Jake: Loading Screen while AI meme is being generated, User Stories, Research additional prompts for AI memes, Role Documentation
- Isaac: Pointer for Backwards & Forwards Buttons & Share Button
- Mitchell: Share Button, Add adjective Radio Buttons, Testing Documentation on Windows
- Trey: Standup 5 Record, Testing Documentation for Mac
- Huigwang: Button Positioning
