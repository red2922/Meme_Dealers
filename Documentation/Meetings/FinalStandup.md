# Meme Generator Final Standup Record (April 12th, 2024)
This final standup was a short and sweet one. With how much work we’ve been doing these last 3 weeks and reaching
99% of our goals, we decided that today and the weekend was pretty much a free sprint. Cleanup code, add anything to
presentation that should be there, write up a short document of what work you’ve done. See? Short and simple. As a
joke I would copy paste the entire script of the bee movie as a last laugh, but honestly it was a pleasure to work
with the boys o7.
