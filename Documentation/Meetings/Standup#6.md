# Meme Generator Standup Record #6 (April 10th, 2024)
For our final meeting, it was a short and simple one. After briefly looking at the current iteration, we discussed any
difficulties we’ve had implementing the last couple changes. From this discussion, we’ve decided that we may scrap the
loading screen while the ai-generated image is being made, as it causes a conflict with tkinter not wanting to run multiple
functions at once. There is also a bit more work that needs to be added to the share button, as there has been difficulty
with getting the image to copy to clipboard. Other than this, we decided to have this iteration to mostly focus on cleaning
up the code and making any minor changes if we think we’ve figured out the problem. At the end, we assigned tasks to everyone:
- Everyone: Make a documentation over the work they’ve done, add an easter egg if haven’t already, look through code and clean it up
- Jake: Make Presentation
- Mitchell: finish implementing adjectives buttons, share button copy to clipboard
- Isaac: share button copy to clipboard
- Trey: Standup Record 6
- Huigwang: button positioning close to UI
