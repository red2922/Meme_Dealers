# April 3rd Meme Generator Standup Record #3
 &nbsp; At the start of this standup meeting, we presented our current iteration of the program to the class. Afterwards, we
 discussed when and how we were going to merge the current sprint into the main in order to keep it the most up-to-date
 version before creating a new sprint branch. We then moved on to view and discuss the mockup UI and what changes and
 additions could be made. Once it was reviewed, we established and assigned the team to the next steps, which were:
- Trey: Standup Record #3 & Testing Documentation for Sprint 4
- Isaac: Research over possibility of share button to twitter
- Jake: Implement Open_AI into main python file
- Mitchell: Redesign of Lvl 1 DFD & New Mockup UI with discussed changes
- Huigwang: Make the program buttons have a fixed position
