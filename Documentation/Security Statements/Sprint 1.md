#Security Statement for Meme Dealers
##Sprint 1
For the first sprint, security is not a concern due to this sprint being designed as a purely internal prototype.  
Due to the prototype's simplicity (push button, get meme) and the fact that it only interacts with the user's PC
there are no major security requirements for this current iteration of the Meme Dealers program.
