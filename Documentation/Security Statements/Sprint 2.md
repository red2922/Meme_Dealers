# Security Statement
## Sprint 2
Similar to the previous sprint, security is not considered a major issue due to the current iteration using a push-button design that does not allow the user to mess with the program in any immediately obvious way.
Since the program is also restricted to only the user's device at the moment as well, there is no focus on security as all the user can do is mess with their own computer if they manage to change the code in any
malicious way.  Security will increase as further progress is made since future iterations will use APIs to connect to image-generating AIs and may allow for user input to these AIs as this represents a risk for
malicious workarounds pushed either to or from these APIs.  User input to the AIs will need to be focused on as well to prevent the user from inputting prompts that may not be allowed by the AI we choose.  This
will all be further refined in future sprints.
