# Sprint 5 Security Statement
On the current sprint, the main focus is in refactoring the current hardcoded buttons to a class based system to allow for easier addition of buttons and more overall functionality.  Given that the 
buttons will remain functionally the same when using the program, there are minimal security concerns regarding them.  There will also be an addition of several share buttons linking users to social 
media websites such as the previously implemented Twitter link, as well as a Facebook, Discord, and Reddit link.  The main concern with linking these websites is in ensuring that the links used do go 
to the correct website, as linking users to fake instances of these websites could potentially lead to users losing their social media accounts to fraudulent login screens or having malware downloaded 
through the fake websites.  Apart from this main concern from the share buttons, there are no major concerns as the current share button only opens the webpage itself.  Because the current sprint 
design will have these links as being hardcoded to the correct websites, the program only having access to open the websites without pasting any information or images to the websites, and the program 
having no ability to interact with computers outside of the computer the program is being run on, security for this sprint is considered to be a minor concern.
