# Sprint 6 Security Statement 
Sprint 6 mostly focused on implementing radio buttons to act as user prompts.  This use of radio buttons was perfomred in order to limit user input to what is given within the program. 
The reason for this use of radio buttons is to prevent users from inputting bad/illegal prompts to DALL-E during use, as improper use of DALL-E can lead to a ban on the API key used to 
access the AI.  By limiting the user's options when generating memes to a small set of whitelisted prompts and concatenating the chosen prompts, the program is unlikely to encounter any
bad prompts that may cause issues with DALL-E.  This also prevents any potentially malicious inputs from the user to DALL-E.
